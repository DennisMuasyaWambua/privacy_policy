Subscription period 

An Arronax Media Service Subscription will commence when the Subscriber registers to use the Arronax Media Service, set at least one payment instrument (e.g. credit card, voucher or agreement with telecommunications operator) and we accept the registration. The subscription and this agreement will continue thereafter on a month-to-month basis until it is ended by the Subscriber or us in one of the ways set out in these Arronax Media Terms. 

Free trial terms and conditions 

We may sometimes allow the Subscriber to end the subscription to use the Arronax Media Service within a period of 14 days after the Subscriber registers (or such other period we may specify upon registration) and we will not charge the Subscriber for use of the Arronax Media Service during this time ("Free Trial"). If we give a Subscriber a Free Trial and the Subscriber does not cancel the subscription before the end of the Free Trial period, the Subscriber will be required to pay the Monthly Fee and the subscription will continue on a month-to-month basis until we or the Subscriber end this agreement in the way set out in clause 16 (see clause 10 for more information on the Monthly Fee). 

Free Trials are strictly reserved for first-time Subscribers. You will not qualify for a Free Trial if your payment details have been used to pay for a subscription on another Arronax Media Account or if you have registered before. 

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to determine whether you are entitled to a Free Trial. 

If the Subscriber cancels the subscription before the end of the Free Trial, you will continue to have access to the Arronax Media Service for the remainder of the Free Trial period. 

Payment and Billing 

Monthly subscription fees 

A Subscriber must pay the monthly subscription fee that we set from time to time and all taxes that we are required to charge on this fee (the "Monthly Fee"). 

The Monthly Fee excludes any internet, data, service provider or Access Device costs, which shall be for your own account. 

The Monthly Fee must be paid by the Subscriber each month in advance and for every month in which the Subscriber remains registered to use the Arronax Media Service (each such month is referred to as a "Subscription Period"). For this purpose, the monthly periods shall be calculated from the date on which the Subscriber registers for the Arronax Media Service until the corresponding date in the following month (eg. if you registered on 15 March, the first monthly period will continue until 15 April, and the next monthly period will continue until 15 May and so forth). However, if the Subscriber was given the Free Trial, the monthly period will be calculated from the day after the Free Trial expires and continue until the corresponding day in the following month (notwithstanding that your subscription started at the beginning of the Free Trial period). 

We will bill the Subscriber on or within a reasonable period after the monthly calendar day corresponding to the day that the Subscriber registered to access the Arronax Media Service ("Monthly Billing Date") (eg. if the Subscriber registered on 15 March, the Subscriber's first Monthly Fee will be billed on or after 15 March, and each subsequent Monthly Fee will be billed on the 15th day of each month thereafter). However, if the Subscriber was given the Free Trial, the Monthly Billing Date will be calculated from the day after the Free Trial expires (eg. if the Free Trial ended on 15 March, the first Monthly Billing Date will be 16 March and the 16th day of each month after that). 

The Subscriber must pay the Monthly Fee on each Monthly Billing Date. 

If you are a subscriber of Arronax Media Standard package and you want to switch to Arronax Media Mobile, you are entitled to proceed switch to Arronax Media Mobile package on a date following to the last day of the current prepaid subscription of Arronax Media Standard package. 

If you are a Subscriber of the Arronax Media Mobile package and you want to switch to the Arronax Media Standard package, you are entitled to proceed switch to the Arronax Media Standard package immediately. If you prepaid for your Arronax Media Mobile package, we evaluate the remaining number of prepaid days to Arronax Media credits. Arronax Media credits will remain active on your Arronax Media Account, in case you decide to use Arronax Media Mobile package again we will automatically grant you access to Arronax Media Mobile package for the number of days corresponding to the number of remaining Arronax Media credits. 

Arronax Media may confirm your credit card`s online payment enablement via processing a once-off, immediately refunded charge of one unit in your local currency. 

Pay Per Title	 

A Subscriber can pay the per title fee that we set from time to time and all taxes that we are required to charge on this fee (the "Per Title Fee"). 

The Per Title Fee excludes any internet, data, service provider or Access Device costs, which shall be for your own account. 

The per title fee must be paid before the subscriber has access to the title. 

 

Changes to Monthly Fee 

We may increase the Monthly Fees from time to time. 

We will give the Subscriber at least 30 days prior written notice of any increases to the Monthly Fee. 

Where the Subscriber does not agree to the adjusted Monthly Fee, the Subscriber may cancel the subscription in accordance with clause 16.

If you choose to pay using PayPal, you will be establishing a billing agreement between yourself and PayPal, which will allow PayPal to set up a subscription with you in terms of which PayPal will bill you on recurring basis. You will be billed in your local currency in terms of PayPal’s reference transaction method. The actual amount that you will be charged will be in your local currency and will depend on the exchange rate applied by your financial institution. In addition you acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary for reasons that include, without limitation, differing amounts due to promotional offers such as gift card redemption, vouchers and promotional code redemption, and you authorise PayPal to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts. PayPal will maintain the billing agreement and you reserve the right to cancel such billing agreement by logging onto your account profile with PayPal.
